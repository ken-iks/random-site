      The important question to ask about lions hub, naturally, is what seperates it
      from any other blog platforms? Why not substack, or medium, or any of
      the thousand other platforms that out there? Well the answer to that is 
      simple: because I made it!
    </p>
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <p> Until the lion learns to write, EVERY story will glorify the hunter. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
